Module 2
Based on the reformat code. I was unable to reformat the code to deliver a change in process time for both 2018 and 2017. The screenshots provided are from the normal times Iâ€™ve received from the normal code that was taught in the modules. Based on my assumptions refactoring a code can definitely improve the run times of a analysis however, if one were to input an incorrect variable from the original code it will increase the time one might take to run the code as opposed to getting the standard time of running the original code.
